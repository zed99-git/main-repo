    <h1>Tips for Fluffy Omelettes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Prep fillings ahead</b> – since omelettes take just a few minutes to cook, make sure all of your filings 
        and toppings are prepped before you turn on the stove.</li>
        <li><b>Foamy eggs</b> – beat the eggs and salt with a fork until the eggs are foamy. 
        The bubbles will give your egg more rise and become puffy as it cooks.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid peppe</b> – since the black pepper doesn’t dissolve into the egg, it will pool at the bottom and give your omelet 
        an ugly appearance. Save the pepper for sprinkling over the finished omelette if desired.</li>
        <li><b>Reduce the heat</b> – Once the eggs are in the pan, reduce 
            the heat to low to give your eggs a chance to cook through without browning.</li>
        <li><b>Be patient –</b> it’s tempting to crank up the heat for the omelette to cook faster 
            but doing so will brown and ruin the eggs.</li>
        <p><b style="margin-right: 3%; font-size: small;">Note*</b></p>
       <ol>
         <li style="font-size: small;">Non-stick pan makes it easier to flip your omelette. 
        You don’t need a fancy omelette pan.</li>   
        <li style="font-size: small;">Please be careful when using heat appliances, watch the video below for more information</li>

    <h1>How to Make Omelette</h1>
    <p>There’s nothing worse than an overcooked omelette. It should be cooked until it’s just set and not browned. Once it’s browned, 
        the egg deteriorates</p>
    <p>in flavor and texture. Follow these steps for moist and fluffy omelettes every time.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Beat eggs</p> – in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt then beat with a fork until frothy.</li>
        <li><p>Heat skilet</p> - place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. 
            Once butter is melted and bubbly, add beaten eggs and reduce heat to low.
        </li>
        <li><p>Pulled cooked eggs</p> - with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to 
            fill in the space. Watch the video tutorial above to see this process in action.</li>
            <li><p>Flip</p> – once eggs are nearly set, the omelette slides 
            easily on the skillet and you can get a spatula underneath, flip it over. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li><p>Fold</p> – add cheese and your favorite toppings, fold the omlette and slide it onto a plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
